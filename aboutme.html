        <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
          <p>I have chosen not to include any personal information in this blog, however I will share some snippets about me. I’m currently studying a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. One of the reasons why I am studying this degree is because I love technical and mechanical things. I love to tinker around with things and trying to build stuff around the house. At the moment I am trying to work out how to make an automated entertainment system – connecting a Google Home into a projector to make it play movies via voice command. It’s a working progress.</p>
        <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
          <p>I have two main hobbies; cars and tech. Any kind of tech. It’s a bit corny, however since I was kid I was always playing around with technology and getting in trouble with turning on the family car. I have a passion for racing and the car scene and it goes hand in hand with my love of technology. In a way, they provide me with an adrenaline rush and also a mental challenge. I go through phases with my hobbies. I’ve just taken up photography and I love gaming. Whatever is the flavour of the month really.</p>
        <h3>My Interest in IT</h3>
          <p>My interest for IT stemmed from wanting to learn about how things work. Especially technical things like the TV or the lights. There is no specific time where I became interested in technology; it was a combination of things that led me to it.</p>
          <p>As I am an impatient adrenaline junkie, I cannot stand repetition. This is why I was drawn to information technology. It constantly evolves and adapts based on what people want and need. There’s constant change within the technical space. This keeps me interested because it allows me to use my problem-solving skills to tackle a problem.</p>
        <h3>Why RMIT? </h3>
          <p>The RMIT Bachelor of Information Technology course was an attractive choice as it provided me with the flexibility of pursuing a university course online while being able to work-full time. This was an important factor in my selection of RMIT because it allowed me to balance my life. After looking at the course structure, I was particularly happy with how it allowed me to pick courses at my own pace.</p>
        <h3>Learning Expectations</h3>
          <p>Aside from learning about information technology and how it affects the wider world; I was definitely interested in learning some of the technical skills that my studies afforded me. For example, some of these courses are programming based. I hope to leverage some of the technical skills in those courses (not just the programming aspect of it) for projects I would like to work on in my spare time. For example, I have already picked up GitHub, Discord, Trello skills whilst pursing my studies and I hope to apply these skills in my everyday life. I am also excited to learn about how to build projects and how to deploy them.</p>
        <h2>Dream Job</h2>
        <p>My ideal job is a solution architect. This URL has been taken from the website www.seek.com: https://www.seek.com.au/job/39256452?searchrequesttoken=f2ca4bc1-659d-4dfe-ad19-1c1548248303&type=standout</p>
        <h3>Job Appeal</h3>
          <p>I am interested in a role like this because it a combination a technical role that leverages in working collaboratively with others. It is not a purely technical or dev role, but it requires a similar level of problem-solving ability. This particular role specifies AWS Cloud technologies, so it has an additional level of technical challenge. This is appealing to me because I am interested in a role that is dynamic but also technical. This job requires the individual to work with a bunch of different stakeholders and manage their requirements when building a solution. I like the idea of being able to develop technical designs and support different teams. The AWS side of this was particularly interesting because it delves into the automation space. I feel like automation is the way of the future, so having a foot in that area would be beneficial in the long run.</p>
        <h3>Job Description</h3>
