    <h2>Analysis</h2>
    <p>I did three assessments. My Myers-Briggs assessment was ENJF-T. I have
      done this test once before in the past and more recently at work, and
      I got the same results both times. I also did an Interpersonal Skill assessment
      which assessed my soft skills. Surprisingly, I had a high EQ and doing my Learning
      Style Test, I had tactile/kinesthetic learning patterns. I feel like this in
      an accurate snapshot of my personality. I am very empathetic towards others. This can be a
      beneficial trait in promoting the cohesiveness in a team.
     </p>
     <p>Looking at my learning style test, I came out to be a more of tactile/kinesthetic learner. I
       prefer learning things that I can physically interact with. This might be difficult in an online
       group setting as I might lose interest if I cannot engage with it.</p>
     <p>Forming a team might be difficult for me. When looking at my interpersonal skills, I may come
     across as too extroverted and domineering. The 48% on my listening skills means I could potentially struggle
   to take constructive feedback. I can be too sensitive. Overall, if I would do best informing
 a team if I had to build something from scratch and I had constant conversations with others. I would likely
prosper in a more agile project</p>
